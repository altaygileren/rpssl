- What is Rock Paper Scissors Spock Lizard?
It is an improvement on the game of Rock Paper Scissors. It adds more thought into the regular game and more options to create more unique scenarios.

- Wireframe
I have two separate but similar themes in wireframes for the game

- Initial thoughts on the game structure
It adds more thought into the what the "user" will throw as their choice than just 3 options.

- Phases of completion
First and foremost finish the wireframe, then figure out how I will tackle the logic aspect on how th computer and users choices will be compared, then the actual design and theme of the website.
